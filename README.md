# DAGAN
This repository contains materials for a seminar on the 2017 paper "Data Augmentation Generative Adversarial Networks" by Antoniou, Storkey, and Edwards (arXiv:1711.04340). The seminar covers the key concepts, methodology, and implications of the DAGAN model, which uses generative adversarial networks to enhance datasets through synthetic data generation. Additionally, this repository includes scripts for testing the DAGAN model on various datasets
